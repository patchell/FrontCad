# FrontCad
A simple CAD program for making front panels and simple drawings

As of today, I am still in the throws of trying to repurpose code 
that I wrote some time ago.  I probably should have started from 
scratch.  I keep getting closer, I got the compile errors down to 
about 1499 but are back up to almost 1600.  Really funny how 
fixing problems can actually cause more problems. ;)

Still trying to modify the files, and I am making progress.  The
compile errors are finally starting to go down and are around
about 1230.

Who Boy...Search and Replace can save a lot of time, but not
if you make a boo-boo ;)  Repaired most of the damage, and also
did some other clean up, but no real progress at least tonight.

Feb 1, 2022
Finally making good process of correcting the compile errors.
I really really should have started from Scratch.

Feb 28, 2022
Finally have the source code compiling and I have an exe file
that actually runs (may not work, but it runs), so now it is
time to systematically debug the code.

March 18, 2022
Finally got the code running and I am at the point where I
need to start getting the code for drawing objects to work.
I hope that will be quick.  OK, well I hope it won't be
real long.  Oh yes, In case you didn't Notice, I am using
C++20 now to compile.  Probably C++17 will work, but C++14
will give you errors.

The project is, in my opinion, progressing fairly well.  One 
huge impediment is the "ah ha...I can do that much better", like
for example, the last three days ;).  Made some major changes to 
the drawing objects, that I think will make them cleaner in the
long run, and the scrolling seems to be operational.  Not only
the manual scrolling, but the auto scrolling as well...well,
ok, maybe an exaggeration.  It is so fast that it is not very
useful, so that will have to be slowed down a bit.  And it is still
possible to draw a few objects.

Something happened between me an the repo.  Couldn't fix it, so deleted it and then recreated  :(

Auto Scrolling Is working!  Something I thought would be real hard is actually very easy.  On to the meat of the program.

April 14, 2022
The commits may be very sparse for a bit.  Making another radical change to the code.  I really should have planned 
this out from the start, although, probably the same thing might have happened.  I just seem to always have one
of those moments when I say "oo-oo doing this will be really cool!"

April 29, 2022
After chasing my tail for a couple of weeks, I have ironed out problems I was having with Rulers/Zoom/Origins.
I did convert the way I am offsetting the screen when it is scrolled.  And that looks like a good improvement.
If the code look dumb, probably it is.

Wow, what an ordeal.  Since May, I have made a lot of changes because things just became really weird.  The objects were 
just getting too cumbersome, so I made some basic changes to the drawing objects that should, hopefully, make things a bit better.
With this push, it is at the very least drawing lines.  I did not do any pushes so I at least knew that I had a working
copy of the program.

I took a bit of a vacation from FrontCad.  I am truing to figure out how I should implement Snaps.
I thought I had a good way to do it, but it was totally bogus.
Anyway, today, I made drawing a rectangle work a lot better.

Among other things, All three of my computers died in a matter of about 3 weeks.  
One of them has been repaired, thankfully, but for the last month and a half, things 
have been in a turmoil.  Hopefully, progress will be a little more consistence.

June 27, 2023
Made a lot of major changes.  Sort of rolled back the scope a bit.
It should be noted that the exe crashes on startup.  Fix it soon...

March 3, 2024
It has been a while since I worked on this.  Got some more
drawing functionality, fixed or disabled spelling errors, and am continuing
to get things in place to start saving and loading files.
