# FrontCad
A simple CAD program for making front panels and simple drawings

As of today, I am still in the throws of trying to repurpose code 
that I wrote some time ago.  I probably should have staqrted from 
scratch.  I keep getting closer, I got the compile errors down to 
about 1499 but are back up to almost 1600.  Really funny how 
fixing problems can actuall cause more problems. ;)

Still trying to modify the files, and I am making progress.  The
compile errors are finally starting to go down and are around
about 1230.

Whoo Boy...Search and Replace can save a lot of time, but not
if you make a boo-boo ;)  Repaired most of the damage, and also
did some other clean up, but no real progress at least tonight.

Finally making good process of correcting the compile errors.
I really really should have started from Scratch.

Finally have the source code compiling and I have an exe file
that actually runs (may not work, but it runs), so now it is
time to systematically debug the code.

Finally got the code running and I am at the point where I
need to start getting the code for drawing objects to work.
I hope that will be quick.  OK, well I hope it won't be
real long.  Oh yes, In case you didn't Notice, I am using
C++20 now to compile.  Probably C++17 will work, but C++14
will give you errors.

The project is, in my opinion, progressing fairly well.  One 
huge impediment is the "ah ha...I can do that much better", like
for example, the last three days ;).  Made some major changes to 
the drawing objects, that I think will make them cleaner in the
long run, and the scrolling seems to be operational.  Not only
the manual scrolling, but the auto scrolling as well...well,
ok, maybe an exageration.  It is so fast that it is not very
usefull, so that will have to be slowed down a bit.  And it is still
possible to draw a few objects.

Something happened betweem me an the repo.  Couldn't fix it, so deleted it and then recreated  :(

Auto Scrolling Is working!  Something I thought would be real hard is actually very easy.  On to the meat of the program.

The commits may be very sparse for a bit.  Making another radical change to the code.  I really should have planned 
this out from the start, although, probably the same thing might have happened.  I just seem to always have one
of those moments when I say "oo-oo doing this will be really cool!"
